# MyITOPS-2019
Abstract

The objective of this project is to develop an actuator to control the vehicleâ€™s throttle pedal on a chassis dynamometer. The actuator will be controlled remotely by software running on a separate device. The application of the device can be used in vehicle testing. The actuator can imitate human foot movement to push the throttle pedal to simulate human driving. The device will be connected to the internet, which enables a test engineer to test and control the car, respectively the speed of the test car at any time and any place around the world if there is a stable and fast internet connection. The user can display and record measured values of the car in real time. In this project we cover detailed explanation on actuator design, electrical assembly, software and results. The device will help the automotive industry and save time and cost for test engineers.
